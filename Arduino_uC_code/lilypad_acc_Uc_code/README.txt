upload the content of the lilypad_acc folder as an arduino sketch (don't forget to select the arduino LilyPad USB board as the board where you upload the code) in the arduino IDE that can be found here
http://arduino.cc/en/Main/Software
then upload the sketch on the arduino uC and from there on everything should work.
